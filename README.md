# Cleveland brews API

This API, [hosted on render](https://cleveland-brews-api.onrender.com/breweries/overview), lists breweries in Cleveland, along with their coordinates, website, phone number, and information about their cheapest high-abv beer. The ultimate goal is to make an API that can help people wanting to go out drinking on a budget to be able to determine how different breweries would fit into their budget.

This is a very simple API written in Nodejs.
